                        <p>This project was an assignment for a course over javascript at <strong>Full Sail University</strong>.
                        In it I had to take a pre-made store page and add it&#39s functionality, this included:
                        adding items to the cart by dragging them, being able to add to the quantity of the item,
                        deleting items one by one, and finally adding a way to clear the entire cart.
                        This was the final project in the javascript course. </p>
