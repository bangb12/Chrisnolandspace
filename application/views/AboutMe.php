                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Christopher Noland, and the short of it is that I'm a web designer. I started my career in web design
                when I became an intern at my high school. Through this I learned that being a web designer was my goal. I was tasked with
                creating and maintaining the school's website, up until just before my graduation. From there I went on to apply for classes
                at Full Sail University, and that leads us to today. My strongest area in web design is most certainly the coding aspect.
                It is the one with which I have tinkered in the most.</p>
