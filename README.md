A server app (Such as MAMP) is required to run this website.
Make sure to put the files in the correct place on your server of choice.
Ensure the port for your server matches the port shown in the config file(port:8888 in this case).

The filepath for the website must be {Your Local server Folder(htdocs in MAMP)/Chrisnolandspace}
If your filepath differs some of the aspects of the code may not work, including one of the config options in Codeigniter.
So when you open the website it should be localhost:8888/Chrisnolandspace

The ability to change the featured image is now implemented. Simply go to the admin panel (located at the bottom) and change it to whatever you like.
I left two images (fp1 and fp2.jpg) for you to change the image around but feel free to add your own with the correct dimension. The text fields do support
simple HTML like <strong> and <em> so feel free to test those as well.

You can change the image path to work with where your image is but it is recommended to save the image in the /img folder.

Database is located in the root folder. Please ensure it is installed on your system before running the website.
