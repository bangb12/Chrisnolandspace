A server app (Such as MAMP) is required to run this website.
Make sure to put the files in the correct place on your server of choice.
Ensure the port for your server matches the port shown in the config file.

The filepath for the website must be {Your Local server Folder(htdocs in MAMP)/Chrisnolandspace}
If your filepath differs some of the aspects of the code may not work, including one of the config options in Codeigniter.
So when you open the website it should be localhost:8888/Chrisnolandspace
